Nditer
Nditer is a function in Numpy.
It is used to select all the elements for an array.


Appending and array.

Adding a value to the end of something is called Appending. In this we add values to the end of the array
using .append() function using Numpy.
Array can be appended because it is an mutable datatype.
A tuple cannot be appended because it's a immutable datatype(Non editable)
We can append literals and variables into an array

np.arange()
Used to get elements from a given range.

Matrix manipulation
In python a matrix can be represented using a 2D list or a 2D array

Matrix operations
1.add() - add elements of matrices
2.subtract() - subtract elements
3.divide() - divide elements
4.multiply() - multiply elements
5.dot() -  multiply row and column of the matrices
6.sqrt() - square of each elements
7.sum(x,axis) - sum of elements in a matrix, can specify sum of row or column
8."T" - transpose
